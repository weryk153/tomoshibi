REM Tomoshibi - Windows launcher (double-clickable)
REM ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
REM Double-click this file to start your companion.
REM
REM What it does:
REM   1. Makes sure `uv` (the Python package manager) is installed.
REM   2. Installs/updates dependencies with `uv sync`.
REM   3. Opens your browser to the app.
REM   4. Starts the server (run_server.py).
REM This is also your DAILY launcher - just run it every time.
REM ===========================================================================

title Tomoshibi

REM Always run from the folder this script lives in (the project root).
cd /d "%~dp0"

REM Guard: if double-clicked from INSIDE the .zip (Explorer preview), Windows
REM extracts only this file to a temp folder and the project files are missing.
if not exist "pyproject.toml" (
  echo.
  echo   It looks like you are running this from inside the ZIP file.
  echo   Please first EXTRACT the zip: right-click it, choose "Extract All...",
  echo   then open the extracted folder and double-click start-companion.bat there.
  echo.
  pause
  exit /b 1
)

set "APP_URL=http://localhost:12393"

echo ============================================================
echo   Tomoshibi - starting up
echo ============================================================
echo.

REM --- 1. Ensure uv is installed -------------------------------------------
where uv >nul 2>&1
if %ERRORLEVEL%==0 goto have_uv

REM uv might be installed at the default per-user location but not on PATH.
if exist "%USERPROFILE%\.local\bin\uv.exe" (
  set "PATH=%USERPROFILE%\.local\bin;%PATH%"
)
where uv >nul 2>&1
if %ERRORLEVEL%==0 goto have_uv

echo   'uv' is not installed. Installing it now (one-time)...
echo   (uv is a fast Python package manager from Astral.)
echo.
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -NoProfile -Command "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
set "PATH=%USERPROFILE%\.local\bin;%PATH%"

where uv >nul 2>&1
if %ERRORLEVEL%==0 goto have_uv

echo.
echo   ERROR: uv still isn't available after install.
echo   Close this window, open a new Command Prompt, and run this file again.
echo   Or install manually: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/
echo.
pause
exit /b 1

:have_uv
for /f "delims=" %%i in ('where uv') do set "UV_PATH=%%i"
echo   uv found: %UV_PATH%
echo.

REM --- 2. Install / update dependencies ------------------------------------
REM Provision the project's pinned Python (.python-version = 3.10). uv manages its
REM own interpreters, so this works even if the system Python is 3.13+ (which would
REM otherwise make 'uv sync' fail with 'no interpreter for >=3.10,<3.13').
echo   Making sure the right Python (3.10) is available...
call uv python install 3.10

echo.
echo   Installing dependencies (uv sync)...
echo   The FIRST run downloads about 2-3 GB and can take 10-40 minutes on a
echo   normal connection. Leave this window open.
call uv sync
if %ERRORLEVEL% neq 0 (
  echo.
  echo   Setup did not finish. The most common cause is an interrupted download.
  echo   Check your internet connection and just double-click this file again -
  echo   it resumes from where it left off. If your antivirus blocked it, allow
  echo   this app and retry, or install uv manually from:
  echo       https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/
  echo.
  pause
  exit /b 1
)
echo   Dependencies ready.
echo.

REM --- First run: create conf.yaml from the default template if it's missing -
if not exist "conf.yaml" (
  copy /Y "config_templates\conf.tomoshibi.default.yaml" "conf.yaml" >nul
  echo   Created conf.yaml from the default template.
  echo.
)

REM --- 3. Start the server (it opens the browser itself once it's READY) ---
REM NOTE: we do NOT open the browser here. run_server.py --open-browser waits
REM until the server is actually listening before opening %APP_URL%, so a slow
REM first-run startup (speech-model download) never shows a "connection refused"
REM page. The browser pops up on its own once everything is ready.
echo ============================================================
echo   Server starting. Leave THIS WINDOW OPEN while you chat.
echo   First launch: a small speech model downloads automatically, so the
echo   browser may take a minute to open by itself - that is normal.
echo.
echo   If it does not open on its own, browse to %APP_URL% manually.
echo.
echo   On first run a setup wizard appears in the browser - paste an
echo   API key (OpenAI / Claude / Gemini) OR pick a local Ollama model.
echo.
echo   To quit: close this window (or press Control-C).
echo ============================================================
echo.
call uv run run_server.py --open-browser

echo.
echo   Server stopped.
