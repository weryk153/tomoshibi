# The FIRST time, macOS Gatekeeper may block it: right-click the file ->
# "Open" -> "Open" in the dialog. After that, a double-click works.
#
# What it does:
#   1. Makes sure `uv` (the Python package manager) is installed.
#   2. Installs/updates dependencies with `uv sync`.
#   3. Opens your browser to the app.
#   4. Starts the server (run_server.py).
# This is also your DAILY launcher — just run it every time.
