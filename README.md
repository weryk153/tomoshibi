> [Prefer the terminal?](#prefer-the-terminal-advanced)) or package it yourself.

## What is this?

**Tomoshibi** turns an on-screen Live2D character into an AI companion you actually talk to — it remembers you, starts conversations on its own, listens while you speak, and goes quiet when you say goodnight.

It is a **friendly re-packaging** of the excellent [Open-LLM-VTuber](https://github.com/Open-LLM-VTuber/Open-LLM-VTuber) project. We stand on its shoulders: upstream provides the rock-solid Live2D + ASR/TTS + LLM plumbing; this fork wraps it into a **download → double-click → chat** experience for non-technical users, and adds a memory system, proactive conversation, natural barge-in voice, character management, an in-app setup wizard, and a fully bilingual (English / 繁體中文) UI.

**Our principles — and what we deliberately do NOT do:**

- **Free and open source, with optional donations.** No paid tier, no paywall.
- **No mobile version.** Desktop only (macOS / Windows).
- **No model marketplace / bundled copyrighted characters.** This avoids the Live2D commercial-licensing trap — we ship only neutral free defaults; you bring your own character, voice, and LLM.

> Built on Open-LLM-VTuber. See [`NOTICE`](./NOTICE) for full attribution and component licenses, and [`README.upstream.md`](./README.upstream.md) for the original project's docs.

## Features

- **Long-term memory** — it remembers who you are and what you're working on, and gets to know you over time. A curated per-character "core memory" is injected into the persona; after each turn the LLM decides what's worth saving. Updates take effect immediately (no restart). Tunable memory cap.
- **Proactive topics** — after a stretch of silence it opens a topic on its own. Optionally pull the latest AI / tech / anime / gaming news to chat about (pure stdlib helper, **no API key needed**).
- **Natural barge-in voice chat** — talk any time; you don't have to wait for the mic, and you can cut it off mid-sentence like a real conversation.
- **Sleep / do-not-disturb mode** — say "晚安" (goodnight) and it stops initiating; it resumes the next time you talk to it. The keyword is configurable.
- **Character management** — create / edit / switch / delete characters: name + persona + Live2D skin + voice + its own separate memory.
- **First-run setup wizard** — paste an API key (OpenAI / Claude / Gemini) or pick a local Ollama model. The wizard runs a quick test call before saving.
- **LLM settings tab** — paste an API key, or pick/type an Ollama model (a local model, or a cloud model served through Ollama).
- **Performance presets** — Light / Standard / High-performance, bundling ASR/TTS engine choice + memory-consolidation frequency + model keep-alive.
- **Cross-language translation** — optional subtitle / voice translation (off by default).
- **Works out of the box** — bundled sample Live2D model + free cloud TTS (edge-tts) + an auto-downloaded speech-to-text model (~1GB; a one-time, several-minute download on the very first launch). You only have to plug in an LLM.
- **Fully bilingual UI** — Traditional Chinese (zh) and English (en).

## Quick start (download → double-click → chat)

The easy path — **no terminal needed.**

> **Before you start: you'll need an AI "brain" (LLM).**
> Tomoshibi is the **body and face** — the avatar, the voice, the memory. The **brain** that actually thinks and talks is a separate AI that *you* provide. You set it up in the first-run wizard. Options, easiest first:
> - **(Recommended — free, private, runs on your own machine) A local model via Ollama.** Install the free **[Ollama](https://ollama.com)** app, then run `ollama pull qwen2.5:3b` in a terminal (a small ~1.9 GB model). Tomoshibi's default already points to it, so it just works — **no account, no API key, no cost, works offline, and your chats never leave your computer.** Fine on a normal 8–16 GB laptop. (Want sharper replies and have the RAM? Pull a bigger model like `qwen2.5:7b` and pick it in Settings.)
> - **(Optional — better quality if your PC is weak) Ollama Cloud free tier.** Ollama can run a bigger model on *its* servers for free (with limits). Needs a free account — see **Option B** below; you must `ollama pull` the cloud model first.
> - **(Optional — best free quality) A free hosted API key.** Google AI Studio (Gemini), Cerebras, or Groq give a free key (no credit card). Best quality of the free options, but needs an account + key and your chats go to that provider. See **Option C**.
> - **(If you already pay for one) A cloud API key** from OpenAI / Claude / Gemini — top quality, a few pennies per chat. See **Option D**.

1. **Get the code.** On the repo page click the green **`<> Code`** button → **Download ZIP**, then unzip it (e.g. to your Desktop). _(Or `git clone` it if you prefer.)_
2. **Double-click the launcher** inside the unzipped folder:
   - **macOS:** `start-companion.command`
   - **Windows:** `start-companion.bat`
   - The first launch installs everything (`uv`, then dependencies) and can take a few minutes. **Leave that window open — it's the server.**
3. Your browser opens to **http://localhost:12393**. On first run a **setup wizard** appears: either **paste an API key** (OpenAI / Claude / Gemini) **or** **pick a local Ollama model**. The wizard tests your choice before saving.

   ![Tomoshibi first-run setup wizard](assets/tomoshibi-setup.png)

   *The first-run setup wizard, where you plug in your AI "brain".*

4. **Restart so your new brain kicks in.** Quit by **closing that same launcher/terminal window from step 2** (that stops the server), then **double-click the launcher again** to start it back up with your new LLM. (The app also notes that an LLM change "takes effect after a restart — or after switching the character once.") Then start chatting; click once on the page to enable audio.

> **macOS Gatekeeper (first launch only):** double-clicking may show *"can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer."* This is normal for an unsigned open-source app. **Right-click** `start-companion.command` → **Open** → **Open** in the dialog. After you allow it once, double-clicking works from then on. (We don't ship a signed/notarized build — this is the free tier.)

> **Windows SmartScreen (first launch only):** double-clicking may show a blue **"Windows protected your PC"** box. This is normal for an unsigned open-source app. Click **More info** → **Run anyway**. After you allow it once, it won't ask again.

Out of the box it uses the bundled **mao** sample Live2D model and **edge-tts** (free cloud voice, no GPU needed). The first run also downloads a speech-to-text model automatically — it's roughly **~1GB**, so the **very first launch does a one-time download + extract that can take several minutes**. The launcher window may look frozen during this — it isn't, so **leave it open and let it finish**; this only happens once.

### Prefer the terminal? (advanced)

Most people should use the **Download ZIP** path above. If you're comfortable with a terminal, you can clone the repo instead. Requires **Python ≥ 3.10, < 3.13** and [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/weryk153/tomoshibi.git && cd tomoshibi
uv sync                  # installs dependencies
uv run run_server.py     # start the server
# open http://localhost:12393  → setup wizard → chat
```

The wizard writes your LLM choice into `conf.yaml` for you. You can still edit it by hand (see below).

---

## Starting, stopping, and auto-start

**To start it (open the "host"):**

- **Windows:** double-click **`start-companion.bat`**
- **macOS:** double-click **`start-companion.command`** — the very first time macOS may block it, so right-click the file → **Open** → **Open**; after that a normal double-click works.

A black command window opens — **that window *is* the server; keep it open while you chat.** Once it's ready it opens the app in your browser by itself (`http://localhost:12393`). Think of it as two parts: the **command window is the engine**, the **browser tab is just the screen**.

> First launch only: it downloads a ~1GB speech model and can take a few minutes — the window may look frozen but isn't. Leave it open and let it finish.

**To stop it:**

- **Close the black command window** (or press **Ctrl + C** inside it). That fully shuts the companion down.
- Closing the **browser tab** only hides the screen — the server keeps running. Close the command window to actually stop it.
- If you installed **Ollama** for a local brain, it keeps running quietly in the background. You can leave it (it's light when idle) or quit it from the system-tray (Windows) / menu-bar (macOS) icon.

**To open it again later:** just run the same launcher again — it's also your daily launcher.

**Start it automatically when your computer turns on (optional):**

- **Windows**
  1. Right-click **`start-companion.bat`** → **Create shortcut**.
  2. Press **Win + R**, type **`shell:startup`**, press **Enter** — this opens your Startup folder.
  3. Drag the shortcut into that folder. Tomoshibi now starts at every login. *(To undo: delete the shortcut from that folder.)*

- **macOS**
  1. Open **System Settings → General → Login Items & Extensions**.
  2. Under **Open at Login**, click **+** and choose **`start-companion.command`** (or drag the file into the list).
  *(To undo: select it and click **−**.)*

Either way the command window (and then the browser) pops up on its own at login. Heads-up: a terminal window appearing every boot is normal — that's the engine starting. If you use a local Ollama brain, the Ollama app already auto-starts after you install it, so the whole companion comes up by itself.

---

## LLM setup (required)

You need **either** an API key for a cloud LLM **or** a running local LLM. A cheap model is plenty for companion chat — you do not need a flagship.

#### Option A — Local Ollama (recommended: free, private, no account)
Install [Ollama](https://ollama.com/download), then run `ollama pull qwen2.5:3b` in a terminal (~1.9 GB). Tomoshibi's default already uses `qwen2.5:3b`, so once the download finishes it works after the next restart — no API key, no account, no cloud cost, fully offline, and your chats stay on your computer. Runs comfortably on a typical 8–16 GB laptop. For sharper replies, pull a bigger model (e.g. `qwen2.5:7b`) and set it in the LLM settings tab.

#### Option B — Cloud models through Ollama (free account; good if your PC is weak)
Ollama can run a *bigger* model on its own servers, so a slow computer still gets good replies. Free tier, but it needs an account and you must pull the model first:
1. Install Ollama from [ollama.com/download](https://ollama.com/download) (v0.12+).
2. Create a free account at [ollama.com](https://ollama.com), then run `ollama signin` in a terminal.
3. **Run `ollama pull gpt-oss:20b-cloud` — you must pull it before it works.** (Just typing the name in Settings is not enough.)
4. In the LLM settings tab, choose Ollama and set the model to `gpt-oss:20b-cloud`.

`gpt-oss:20b-cloud` is the lightest free-tier-friendly model; `qwen3.5:cloud` or `minimax-m3:cloud` are stronger but use up the free limits faster.

> **Honest about "free":** $0 with no credit card, just a free account — but a *light-usage* tier: one cloud model at a time, session limits that reset ~every 5 hours plus weekly limits, and Ollama doesn't publish exact numbers, so heavy chatting can hit a limit until it resets. Inference runs on **Ollama's servers**, so don't send anything you want kept fully private. Cloud models are in preview — **confirm it answers once before relying on it.**

#### Option C — Free hosted API key (Gemini / Cerebras / Groq)
The best chat quality of the free options. Make a free account (no credit card), create an API key, and paste it in the LLM settings tab with the matching base URL:
- **Google AI Studio (Gemini):** `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/openai/` — generous free tier; note Google may use free-tier chats to improve its products.
- **Cerebras:** `https://api.cerebras.ai/v1` — very fast, ~1M tokens/day free (short context window on the free tier).
- **Groq:** `https://api.groq.com/openai/v1` — very fast, with daily token caps.

Use a current model name from each provider's docs. Your chats go to that provider, and free tiers have rate limits.

#### Option D — Paid cloud API key (OpenAI / Claude / Gemini)
If you already pay for one, paste the key in the wizard. Highest quality; a small model is typically just pennies per chat.

### ⚠️ Reasoning ("thinking") models need their reasoning turned off

Reasoning models such as **`glm-4.7:cloud`** put their answer in a separate `reasoning` field and leave the normal `content` field **empty**. This app reads only `content`, so a reasoning model will show up as a **blank reply** — and since there's nothing to read aloud, **no voice either**.

**Recommendation:** pick a normal (non-reasoning) chat model. A small, fast model gives a more natural, lower-latency companion anyway.

**If you want to use one anyway:** most endpoints let you switch the reasoning off, and then the model behaves like a normal chat model. Add `extra_body` to your LLM block in `conf.yaml`:

```yaml
extra_body:
  reasoning_effort: 'none'
```

The parameter name differs per provider — check your endpoint's docs. Tested against LM Studio with `qwen3.5`, only `reasoning_effort` worked; `chat_template_kwargs.enable_thinking`, a `/no_think` prefix, and `reasoning.enabled` were all silently ignored. Turning reasoning off also removes a large latency hit: left on, that model spent thousands of characters reasoning before saying a single sentence.

> Manual edit: the LLM config lives under `character_config → agent_config → llm_configs → openai_compatible_llm` in `conf.yaml`. Comments in the file show how to point at OpenAI / Claude / Gemini with your own key. Restart the launcher after editing.

---

## Other settings

### Memory (core + deep recall)
On by default. Each character keeps its own memory at `chat_history/<conf_uid>/core_memory.md` — persona-injected core memory plus per-turn LLM consolidation (the model decides what to keep). Tune the memory cap in settings.

### Characters
Create / edit / switch / delete characters in the app — each has its own name, persona, Live2D skin, voice, and **separate memory**. To add your own Live2D model, drop it under `live2d-models/<name>/`, add an entry in `model_dict.json`, and select it. **Do not commit copyrighted character models to a public repo.**

#### More characters (optional)
For licensing safety, Tomoshibi bundles only **3 free Live2D Original Characters** (`mao_pro`, `haru`, `hiyori`). Want more — including the male butler character **Natori**? You can download free official Live2D sample models yourself from the official page and drop them in. Get them from **[Live2D's sample models page](https://www.live2d.com/en/learn/sample/)** under Live2D's own license — we don't redistribute them. See [`docs/add-live2d-character.md`](docs/add-live2d-character.md) for the how-to.

### Performance presets
**Light / Standard / High-performance** presets bundle the ASR/TTS engine choice, memory-consolidation frequency, and model keep-alive. Pick Light on a modest machine, High-performance if you have the hardware.

### Proactive topics & news
The companion opens topics after idle time. Optionally refresh those topics with current headlines via the bundled news helper (`scripts/news_topics.py`) — pure stdlib, no API key — and schedule it (cron / launchd / Task Scheduler), e.g. every few hours.

### Sleep / quiet mode
Say "晚安" to stop it initiating; it resumes on your next message. The keyword is configurable.

### Translation
Optional cross-language subtitle/voice translation, **off by default** (`tts_preprocessor_config → translator_config` in `conf.yaml`).

### Voice
Default is **edge-tts** (free, no hardware). For a high-quality local/custom voice, run [GPT-SoVITS](https://github.com/RVC-Boss/GPT-SoVITS) as a service and point the config at it (needs a GPU or Apple Silicon). Voice-cloning a real person's voice is your legal responsibility.

---

## Troubleshooting

**The app won't open / the black window closes right away.**
Usually a settings or engine choice an older build couldn't recover from. Download the **latest release** — it opens even with an old setting. If you'd rather not update: open `conf.yaml` in the app folder, find `asr_model: 'faster_whisper'`, change it to `asr_model: 'sherpa_onnx_asr'`, save, and relaunch. (Don't restore `conf.yaml.backup` — it has the same setting.)

**It replies in text but there's no voice.**
Update to the latest release (it bundles the audio tools Windows needs) and run the launcher again so dependencies refresh. If you switched the voice (TTS) engine to GPT-SoVITS, that needs a separate service running — switch back to **Edge TTS** in Settings → Performance for the free built-in voice.

**On the first launch the browser says "this site can't be reached / connection refused."**
The server is still starting — the first run downloads a ~1GB speech model, which takes a few minutes. Leave the black window open; once it prints that it's running, refresh `http://localhost:12393`. The latest release opens the browser only when it's ready.

**Windows: "Windows protected your PC" (SmartScreen), or nothing seems to happen.**
Click **More info → Run anyway** — this is the launcher, not a virus (it's just unsigned). If your antivirus blocked the one-time `uv` install, allow the app and run the launcher again, or install `uv` manually from <https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/> and retry.

**macOS: "cannot be opened because it is from an unidentified developer."**
Right-click `start-companion.command` → **Open** → **Open**. You only need to do this the first time.

**It opens but never replies / says the AI brain isn't set up.**
You still need an LLM. Open the setup wizard (or Settings → Model): paste an API key (OpenAI / Claude / Gemini), or pick a local Ollama model. For the local route, make sure the **Ollama app is installed and running** and the model is downloaded.

**Web search / tools don't work with Claude.**
The setup wizard connects Claude through a compatibility endpoint that doesn't pass tools through, so the experimental web-search/tools toggle may do nothing on Claude. For tools, use a tool-calling model like GPT-4o or Gemini, or a capable local model. (Plain chat with Claude works fine.)

## 這是什麼？

**Tomoshibi** 把一個 Live2D 角色變成你真的會去聊天的 AI 桌面陪伴：它記得你、會自己開話題、你說話時它會聽、你說「晚安」它就安靜下來。

它是把優秀的開源專案 [Open-LLM-VTuber](https://github.com/Open-LLM-VTuber/Open-LLM-VTuber) 重新打包成**對小白友善**的版本。我們站在它的肩膀上：上游提供穩定的 Live2D + 語音辨識/合成 + LLM 底層，這個 fork 則把它包成「**下載 → 雙擊 → 開聊**」的體驗，並加上長期記憶、主動話題、自然插話語音、角色管理、首次啟動設定精靈，以及完整的中英雙語介面。

**我們的原則 — 以及我們刻意不做的事：**

- **免費開源 + 捐款**：沒有付費版、沒有付費牆。
- **不做手機版**：只做桌面（macOS / Windows）。
- **不做模型市集、不附帶有版權的角色**：藉此避開 Live2D 商用授權的陷阱 — 我們只附中性的免費預設，角色、語音、LLM 都由你自己帶。

> 本專案建構於 Open-LLM-VTuber 之上。完整致謝與各元件授權見 [`NOTICE`](./NOTICE)，原專案文件保留於 [`README.upstream.md`](./README.upstream.md)。

## 功能亮點

- **長期記憶**：它會記得你是誰、你在忙什麼，並隨時間越來越了解你。每個角色有一份「核心記憶」注入人設；每輪結束後由 LLM 決定哪些值得存下來。更新即時生效，不用重啟。記憶上限可調。
- **主動話題**：沉默一段時間後它會自己開話題。可選擇抓最新的 AI／科技／動漫／遊戲新聞來聊（純標準函式庫，**不需要 API key**）。
- **自然插話語音對話**：隨時都能開口，不必等麥克風，也能像真人對話一樣中途打斷它。
- **睡眠／勿擾模式**：說「晚安」它就停止主動發話，下次你跟它說話時恢復。關鍵字可改。
- **角色管理**：建立／編輯／切換／刪除角色 — 名稱＋人設＋Live2D 皮＋語音＋各自獨立的記憶。
- **首次啟動設定精靈**：貼上 API key（OpenAI／Claude／Gemini）或選本地 Ollama 模型，存檔前會先做一次測試呼叫。
- **LLM 設定分頁**：貼上 API key，或選擇／手動填入一個 Ollama 模型（本地模型，或透過 Ollama 提供的雲端模型）。
- **效能預設**：輕量／標準／高效能三檔，一鍵搭配好 ASR/TTS 引擎＋記憶整理頻率＋模型常駐。
- **跨語言翻譯**：可選的字幕／語音翻譯（預設關閉）。
- **開箱即用**：內建範例 Live2D 模型＋免費雲端語音（edge-tts）＋自動下載的語音辨識模型（約 1GB，僅在第一次啟動時下載一次、需數分鐘），你只要插上一個 LLM。
- **完整中英雙語介面**：繁體中文（zh）與英文（en）。

*Tomoshibi 在桌面上運作：一個你真的會去聊天的 Live2D 角色。*

## 快速開始（下載 → 雙擊 → 開聊）

最簡單的路徑，**完全不用終端機。**

> **開始前先準備好：你需要一顆 AI「大腦」（LLM）。**
> Tomoshibi 是**身體和臉** — 角色外型、聲音、記憶都有了。但真正會思考、會講話的**大腦**，是一個另外的 AI，要由**你**來提供。你會在首次啟動精靈裡設定它。選項由簡到繁：
> - **（推薦 — 免費、私密、跑在你自己的電腦上）透過 Ollama 用本地模型。** 安裝免費的 **[Ollama](https://ollama.com)** app，然後在終端機執行 `ollama pull qwen2.5:3b`（一個約 1.9 GB 的小模型）。Tomoshibi 的預設本來就指向它，所以直接就能用 — **不用帳號、不用 API key、零費用、可離線、而且你的對話永遠不會離開你的電腦。** 一般 8–16 GB 的筆電就跑得動。（想要更聰明的回覆、記憶體也夠？拉一個更大的模型，例如 `qwen2.5:7b`，再到設定裡選它。）
> - **（選用 — 電腦較弱時品質更好）Ollama Cloud 免費方案。** Ollama 可以在*它的*伺服器上免費跑一個更大的模型（有額度限制）。需要一個免費帳號 — 見下方**方案 B**；你必須先 `ollama pull` 那個雲端模型。
> - **（選用 — 免費中品質最好）免費的雲端 API key。** Google AI Studio（Gemini）、Cerebras 或 Groq 提供免費 key（免綁信用卡）。免費選項中品質最好，但需要帳號 + key，而且你的對話會送到該供應商。見**方案 C**。
> - **（如果你本來就有付費的）雲端 API key**：來自 OpenAI／Claude／Gemini — 頂級品質，一次聊天幾分錢。見**方案 D**。

1. **取得程式。** 在 repo 主頁點綠色 **`<> Code`** 按鈕 → **Download ZIP**，然後解壓縮（例如解到桌面）。_（習慣用 git 的話 `git clone` 也可以。）_
2. **雙擊資料夾裡的啟動器**：
   - **macOS：** `start-companion.command`
   - **Windows：** `start-companion.bat`
   - 第一次啟動會自動安裝所有東西（先 `uv`，再相依套件），可能要幾分鐘。**那個視窗別關，它就是伺服器本體。**
3. 瀏覽器會自動開到 **http://localhost:12393**。第一次會出現**設定精靈**：**貼上 API key**（OpenAI／Claude／Gemini），**或**選一個本地 **Ollama 模型**。精靈會先測試再存檔。

   ![Tomoshibi 首次啟動設定精靈](assets/tomoshibi-setup.png)

   *首次啟動的設定精靈，在這裡接上你的 AI「大腦」。*

4. **重啟一次，新的大腦才會接上。** 請**把步驟 2 那個啟動器／終端機視窗關掉**結束它（這會停掉伺服器），再**重新雙擊一次啟動器**，讓新的 LLM 接上。（app 裡也會提示，LLM 的變更「會在重啟之後生效 — 或切換一次角色之後生效」。）接著就能開始聊天；點一下頁面以解鎖音訊。

> **macOS Gatekeeper（僅第一次）：** 雙擊時可能跳出「**無法打開，因為來自未識別的開發者**」。這對未簽章的開源 app 是正常的。請對 `start-companion.command` **按右鍵 → 打開 → 打開**。允許一次之後，往後就能直接雙擊了。（我們不提供簽章／公證版本 — 這是免費版。）

> **Windows SmartScreen（僅第一次）：** 雙擊時可能跳出藍色的「**Windows 已保護您的電腦**」視窗。這對未簽章的開源 app 是正常的。請點 **其他資訊** → **仍要執行**。允許一次之後就不會再問了。

開箱使用內建的 **mao** 範例 Live2D 模型與 **edge-tts**（免費雲端語音，不需顯卡）。第一次啟動也會自動下載一個語音辨識模型 —— 它大約 **1GB**，所以**第一次啟動會做一次性的下載＋解壓，可能要好幾分鐘**。這段期間啟動器視窗看起來像卡住了，其實沒有，**請別關掉、讓它跑完**；這只會發生一次。

### 習慣用終端機？（進階）

大多數人用上面的 **Download ZIP** 路徑就好。如果你熟悉終端機，也可以改用 clone 取得專案。需要 **Python ≥ 3.10、< 3.13** 與 [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)。

```bash
git clone https://github.com/weryk153/tomoshibi.git && cd tomoshibi
uv sync                  # 安裝相依套件
uv run run_server.py     # 啟動伺服器
# 開 http://localhost:12393  → 設定精靈 → 開聊
```

## 開啟、關閉、開機自動啟動

**怎麼開（啟動「主機」）：**

- **Windows：** 雙擊 **`start-companion.bat`**
- **macOS：** 雙擊 **`start-companion.command`** —— 第一次系統可能會擋，對檔案按右鍵 → **打開** → 再按一次 **打開**；之後正常雙擊就行。

會跳出一個黑色命令視窗 —— **那個視窗就是伺服器，聊天期間要一直開著。** 等它準備好，會自己用瀏覽器打開 app（`http://localhost:12393`）。可以這樣想：**命令視窗是引擎，瀏覽器分頁只是畫面。**

> 僅限第一次啟動：會下載約 1GB 的語音模型、要等幾分鐘，視窗看起來像卡住其實沒有 —— 讓它開著跑完即可。

**怎麼關：**

- **關掉那個黑色命令視窗**（或在裡面按 **Ctrl + C**），角色就完全停止。
- 只關**瀏覽器分頁**只是隱藏畫面，伺服器還在跑；要真的停掉請關命令視窗。
- 若你裝了 **Ollama** 跑本地大腦，它會在背景持續執行。閒置時很省，可以不管；想關就從工作列（Windows）／選單列（macOS）的圖示 Quit。

**之後要再開：** 再執行同一個啟動器即可（它也是你的日常啟動器）。

**讓它在電腦開機時自動啟動（選配）：**

- **Windows**
  1. 對 **`start-companion.bat`** 按右鍵 → **建立捷徑**。
  2. 按 **Win + R**，輸入 **`shell:startup`**，按 **Enter** —— 會打開「啟動」資料夾。
  3. 把捷徑拖進那個資料夾。以後每次登入都會自動開啟。*（要取消：把該捷徑從資料夾刪掉。）*

- **macOS**
  1. 打開 **系統設定 → 一般 → 登入項目與擴充功能**。
  2. 在 **登入時開啟** 下按 **+**，選 **`start-companion.command`**（或把檔案拖進清單）。
  *（要取消：選取它後按 **−**。）*

兩種方式都會在登入時自動跳出命令視窗（接著是瀏覽器）。提醒：每次開機會跳出一個終端機視窗是正常的，那就是引擎在啟動。若你用本地 Ollama 大腦，Ollama 裝好後本來就會開機自啟，所以整套會自己起來。

## LLM 設定（必做）

你需要**擇一**：雲端 LLM 的 API key，**或**一個本地 LLM。陪伴聊天用便宜的模型就很夠，不需要旗艦級。

#### 方案 A — 本地 Ollama（推薦：免費、私密、不用帳號）
安裝 [Ollama](https://ollama.com/download)，然後在終端機執行 `ollama pull qwen2.5:3b`（約 1.9 GB）。Tomoshibi 的預設本來就用 `qwen2.5:3b`，所以下載完成後、下次重啟就能用 —— 不用 API key、不用帳號、零雲端費用、完全離線，而且你的對話都留在你的電腦上。一般 8–16 GB 的筆電就跑得很順。想要更聰明的回覆，可以拉一個更大的模型（例如 `qwen2.5:7b`），再到 LLM 設定分頁裡選它。

#### 方案 B — 透過 Ollama 用雲端模型（免費帳號；電腦較弱時很適合）
Ollama 可以在它自己的伺服器上跑一個*更大的*模型，所以慢的電腦也能得到不錯的回覆。免費方案，但需要一個帳號、而且你必須先把模型拉下來：
1. 從 [ollama.com/download](https://ollama.com/download) 安裝 Ollama（v0.12+）。
2. 到 [ollama.com](https://ollama.com) 開一個免費帳號，然後在終端機執行 `ollama signin`。
3. **執行 `ollama pull gpt-oss:20b-cloud` —— 必須先拉下來才能用。**（只在設定裡填名字是不夠的。）
4. 在 LLM 設定分頁選 Ollama，把模型設成 `gpt-oss:20b-cloud`。

`gpt-oss:20b-cloud` 是最適合免費額度的輕量模型；`qwen3.5:cloud` 或 `minimax-m3:cloud` 更強，但會更快用掉免費額度。

> **誠實說明「免費」：** 完全 $0、免綁信用卡，只要一個免費帳號 —— 但屬於「輕量使用」等級：一次只能跑一個雲端模型，session 額度每約 5 小時重置一次、外加每週額度，而且 Ollama 沒有公布確切數字，所以聊太多可能會碰到額度上限、要等重置。運算跑在 **Ollama 的伺服器上**，所以不要傳你想完全保密的內容。雲端模型還在 preview 階段 —— **依賴它之前，先確認它真的能回一次。**

#### 方案 C — 免費的雲端 API key（Gemini／Cerebras／Groq）
免費選項中聊天品質最好。開一個免費帳號（免綁信用卡），建立一把 API key，到 LLM 設定分頁貼上 key 並填對應的 base URL：
- **Google AI Studio（Gemini）：** `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/openai/` —— 免費額度大方；注意 Google 可能會用免費方案的對話來改進它的產品。
- **Cerebras：** `https://api.cerebras.ai/v1` —— 很快，每天約 1M token 免費（免費方案的 context window 較短）。
- **Groq：** `https://api.groq.com/openai/v1` —— 很快，有每日 token 上限。

請用各供應商文件裡目前可用的模型名。你的對話會送到該供應商，而且免費方案有速率限制。

#### 方案 D — 付費的雲端 API key（OpenAI／Claude／Gemini）
如果你本來就有付費的，把 key 貼進精靈即可。品質最高；用小模型通常一次聊天只要幾分錢。

### ⚠️ 思考型（reasoning）模型要把推理關掉才能用

像 **`glm-4.7:cloud`** 這類思考型模型，會把答案放在另一個 `reasoning` 欄位，而一般的 `content` 欄位是**空的**。這個 app 只讀 `content`，所以思考型模型會顯示成**空白回覆** — 沒有文字可念，**語音也不會出聲**。

**建議：** 選一個一般（非思考型）的對話模型。小而快的模型反而讓陪伴更自然、延遲更低。

**如果你還是想用：** 多數端點可以把推理關掉，關掉之後它就跟一般對話模型一樣。在 `conf.yaml` 的 LLM 區塊加上 `extra_body`：

```yaml
extra_body:
  reasoning_effort: 'none'
```

參數名各家不同，查你的端點文件。以 LM Studio 搭 `qwen3.5` 實測，只有 `reasoning_effort` 有效；`chat_template_kwargs.enable_thinking`、prompt 前加 `/no_think`、`reasoning.enabled` 三種寫法都被靜默忽略。關掉推理同時解掉一個很大的延遲問題：不關的話那個模型會花數千字推理才講出一句話。

## 其他設定

- **記憶**：預設開啟，每個角色記憶獨立存在 `chat_history/<conf_uid>/core_memory.md`，每輪由 LLM 決定要存什麼。記憶上限可在設定調整。
- **角色**：在 app 內建立／編輯／切換／刪除，每個角色有獨立的名稱、人設、Live2D 皮、語音與記憶。要加自己的模型，放到 `live2d-models/<name>/` 並在 `model_dict.json` 加一筆。**不要把有版權的角色模型 commit 進公開 repo。**
  - **想要更多角色（選用）**：為了授權安全，Tomoshibi 只內建 **3 個免費的 Live2D 原創角色**（`mao_pro`、`haru`、`hiyori`）。想要更多 — 包含男管家角色 **Natori（名取）**？你可以自己到官方頁面下載免費的官方 Live2D 範例模型再放進來。請從 **[Live2D 範例模型頁面](https://www.live2d.com/en/learn/sample/)** 依 Live2D 自己的授權下載 — 我們不代為散布。作法見 [`docs/add-live2d-character.md`](docs/add-live2d-character.md)。
- **效能預設**：輕量／標準／高效能，一鍵搭好引擎、整理頻率與模型常駐。
- **主動話題與新聞**：可用 `scripts/news_topics.py`（純標準函式庫、不需 key）定時更新話題。
- **睡眠／勿擾**：說「晚安」停止主動發話，下次對話恢復，關鍵字可改。
- **翻譯**：可選的跨語言字幕／語音翻譯，預設關閉。
- **語音**：預設 edge-tts（免費、不需硬體）；要高品質本地／自訂語音可接 GPT-SoVITS（需顯卡或 Apple Silicon）。克隆真人聲音的法律責任由你自負。

## 疑難排解

**App 打不開／黑色視窗一開就關。**
多半是改了某個設定／引擎、舊版救不回來。抓**最新版**即可（新版就算帶著舊設定也開得起來）。不想更新的話：打開 app 資料夾的 `conf.yaml`，找到 `asr_model: 'faster_whisper'` 改成 `asr_model: 'sherpa_onnx_asr'`，存檔重開。（別還原 `conf.yaml.backup`，裡面是同一個壞設定。）

**能回文字但沒聲音。**
更新到最新版（內含 Windows 需要的音訊工具），並再跑一次啟動器讓相依更新。如果你把語音（TTS）引擎切成 GPT-SoVITS，那需要另外跑一個服務 —— 到 設定 → 效能 切回 **Edge TTS** 用免費內建語音。

**第一次開，瀏覽器顯示「無法連上這個網站／拒絕連線」。**
伺服器還在啟動 —— 第一次會下載約 1GB 語音模型、要等幾分鐘。讓黑色視窗開著，等它印出在執行了，再重新整理 `http://localhost:12393`。最新版會等伺服器準備好才自動開瀏覽器。

**Windows：「Windows 已保護您的電腦」（SmartScreen），或按了沒反應。**
按 **其他資訊 → 仍要執行** —— 這是啟動器、不是病毒（只是沒簽章）。若防毒擋掉了一次性的 `uv` 安裝，把這個 app 加進允許清單再跑一次，或到 <https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/> 手動裝 `uv` 後重試。

**macOS：「無法打開，因為來自未識別的開發者」。**
對 `start-companion.command` 按右鍵 → **打開** → **打開**。只有第一次需要這樣。

**開得起來但都不回覆／顯示 AI 大腦尚未設定。**
你還沒設定 LLM。打開設定精靈（或 設定 → 模型）：貼一個 API 金鑰（OpenAI / Claude / Gemini），或選一個本地 Ollama 模型。走本地路線要確認 **Ollama app 已安裝並在執行**、而且模型已下載。

**用 Claude 時網路搜尋／工具沒作用。**
設定精靈把 Claude 接到一個相容端點、不會把工具傳過去，所以對 Claude 來說網路搜尋／工具（那個實驗性開關）可能沒效果。要用工具請改用支援工具呼叫的模型，例如 GPT-4o 或 Gemini，或夠強的本地模型。（用 Claude 純聊天是正常的。）
